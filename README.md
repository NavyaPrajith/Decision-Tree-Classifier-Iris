This project presents a **decision tree classification model** applied to the Iris dataset, a well-known benchmark dataset in machine learning. The Iris dataset comprises measurements of sepal and petal dimensions for three species of iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

The decision tree model is trained on this dataset to learn patterns and relationships between the input features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) and the target classes (species of iris). By recursively splitting the feature space based on the most informative attributes, the decision tree algorithm constructs a tree-like structure that facilitates classification.

The objective of this project is to accurately classify iris flowers into their respective species using the decision tree model.

With strong performance in achieving high precision while maintaining a high recall rate, our classifier demonstrates reliability in classification tasks.

Overall, our decision tree classifier offers a dependable solution for accurately categorizing iris species based on feature attributes, making it a valuable asset for classification tasks.
